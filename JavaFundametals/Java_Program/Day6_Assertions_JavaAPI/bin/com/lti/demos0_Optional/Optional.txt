newly introduced Optional class in java.util package. 
This class is introduced to avoid NullPointerException that we frequently encounters 
if we do not perform null checks in our code.

 Using this class we can easily check whether a variable has null value or
not and by doing this we can avoid the NullPointerException.

methods :
isPresent : if a value is present returns true else return false.
isEmpty: Opposite of isPresent. If a value is not present return true.
stream(): Introduced in JDK 9. If a value is present this method returns a sequential Stream containing the value or
 else returns an empty stream.
get: If a value is present return value else throws NoSuchElementException.
orElseThrow: This method is introduced in JDK10. Code wise there is no difference between this and above get method. 
The reasoning behind this method is to use proper naming of the method.
