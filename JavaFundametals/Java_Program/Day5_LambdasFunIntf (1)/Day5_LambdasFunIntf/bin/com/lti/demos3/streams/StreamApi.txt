Stream API Characteristics
Not a data structures: 
Streams have no storage. They carry values from a source through a pipeline of operations. 

They also never modify the underlying data structure.

Designed for lambdas All Stream operations take lambdas as arguments 

Do not support indexed access You can ask for the first element,
 but not the second or third or last element.
Can easily be output as arrays or Lists Simple syntax to build an array or List from a Stream.

Lazy Many Stream operations are postponed until it is known how much data is eventually needed 

Parallelizable If you designate a Stream as parallel,
 then operations on it will automatically be done concurrently,
  without having to write explicit multi-threading code
