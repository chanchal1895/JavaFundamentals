Interfaces, classes, and enums are all "types". Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces. In this way, 
Java supports multiple inheritance of types.

"State", on the other hand, is represented by instance fields. Only a class can have instance fields and therefore, 
only a class can have a state.

 Since a class is allowed to extend only from one class at the most, it can inherit only one state. Thus, 
 Java does not support multiple inheritance of state.
