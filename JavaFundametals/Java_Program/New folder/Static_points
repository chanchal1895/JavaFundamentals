There are two details to notice in this code. First, note that RopeSwing has an
instance initializer and not a static initializer. Since RopeSwing is never constructed,
the instance initializer does not run. The other detail is that length is static. Changes
from one object update this common static variable.


import rope.*;
import static rope.Rope.*;
public class RopeSwing {
 private static Rope rope1 = new Rope();
 private static Rope rope2 = new Rope();
 {
 System.out.println(rope1.length);
 }
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 rope1.length = 2;
 rope2.length = 8;
 System.out.println(rope1.length);
 }
}
package rope;
public class Rope {
 public static int length = 0;
}


static final variables must be set exactly once, and it must be in the declaration
line or in a static initialization block.
