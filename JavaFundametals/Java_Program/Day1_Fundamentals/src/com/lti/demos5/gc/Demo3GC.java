//Garbage collection refers to the process of automatically freeing memory on the heap by  deleting objects that are no longer reachable in your program.
//System.gc() is not guaranteed to run,

//memory belonging to an object can be reclaimed. 
//Java waits patiently until the code no longer needs that memory. 
//An object will remain on the heap until it is no longer reachable. An object is no longer reachable when one of two situations occurs: 
// The object no longer has any references pointing to it. 
// All references to the object have gone out of scope. 

public class Demo3GC {
	public void finalize() {

		System.out.println("Calling finalize"); // finalize() call could run zero or one time.
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		String one, two;
		one = new String("a");
		two = new String("b");
		one = two;
		String three = one;

/***
 * Garbage Collection: The heap, also known as free store, represents a giant
 * pool of unused memory allocated to your Java application; - System.gc()
 * suggests that now might be a good time for Java to kick off a garbage
 * collection run, but is not guaranteed that Java will run it; An object is no
 * longer reachable when one of two situations occurs: - The object no longer
 * has any references pointing to it; - All references to the object have gone
 * out of scope. The method finalize() might not be called and it definitely
 * won't be called twice to collect the object from the heap. Obs.: Objects are
 * always on the heap.
