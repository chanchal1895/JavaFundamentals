Important points

1.Even though foo is a method, you cannot put () in the import statement.
2.Classes cannot be imported using "import static"
3.The order of keywords for a static import must be "import static ... ".

4.Syntax for importing static fields is:  import static <package>.<classname>.*; or import static                       <package>.<classname>.<fieldname>;

5.The package declaration can never occur after an import statement.
The order is:
package statement.
import statements
class/ interface definitions.
Important point to note here is YOU MUST READ THE QUESTIONS VERY CAREFULLY.

6.Each object of a class has its own copy of each non-static member variable.
7.All non-static/instance methods in a class are implicitly passed a 'this' parameter when called.
